# Deployment Guide

This section covers various deployment strategies for the AI-Enhanced Telemetry Processor.

## Deployment Options

The AI-Enhanced Telemetry Processor can be deployed in several ways:

1. **Standalone**: Running directly on a host machine
2. **Docker Container**: Running in a Docker container
3. **Kubernetes**: Running as a pod in a Kubernetes cluster
4. **Cloud Platforms**: Running on AWS, GCP, Azure, or other cloud platforms

## Deployment Considerations

When planning your deployment, consider the following factors:

### System Requirements

- CPU: At least 2 cores recommended
- Memory: At least 512MB of RAM
- Disk: Minimal requirements (< 100MB for the processor and models)
- Network: Access to telemetry sources and exports

### Scaling

The processor can be scaled in two ways:

1. **Vertical Scaling**: Increasing resources (CPU, memory) and concurrency settings
2. **Horizontal Scaling**: Running multiple instances with load balancing

See the [Performance](../performance/index.md) section for details on optimizing performance.

### High Availability

For production environments, consider:

- Deploying multiple instances for redundancy
- Using Kubernetes for automatic restarts and health checks
- Implementing proper monitoring and alerting

### Security

Security considerations include:

- WASM model validation and verification
- TLS encryption for telemetry transport
- Proper access controls for configuration and models
- Regular updates to address security patches
